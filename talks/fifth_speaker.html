 <h3>Title of the Talk: Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cardiac Healthcare</h3>
 <p><b>Abstract of the Talk: </b>Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly 
    gaining popularity within the biomedical community for automated detection of various 
    cardiovascular disorders. In medical applications, AI methods attempt to cluster patient 
    traits or infer the probability of the disease outcome. Cardiovascular disorders 
    have three basic origins. They are conduction abnormalities, myocardial abnormalities 
    and valve related abnormalities. These three abnormalities are interrelated and they 
    lead to different cardiac disorders. In clinical settings, cardiovascular abnormalities 
    are diagnosed using electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and phonocardiogram (PCG) signal, as 
    well as medical context including patient symptoms, medical history, and risk factors. 
    These pieces of information are generally found in electronic health records (EHR). 
    Analysis of such data requires natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract 
    information from such as clinical notes/medical journals to supplement and enrich 
    structural medical data. The challenges in this area include not only processing of 
    time series data such as ECG and PCG but also analyzing the textual data. In this 
    presentation, we will discuss the significance of diagnostic information in ECG 
    signal, heart sound signal or Phonocardiogram (PCG) and electronic health records 
    (EHR). Some applications of state-of-art AI techniques in this area will be discussed.</p>
