    <h3>Title of the Talk: Recent advances in chemical sensor technology</h3>
    <p><b>Abtract of the Talk: </b>Gas sensors are more and more requested nowadays for the several applications like
        industrial pollution, food safety, human’s health. Research in this field is constantly evolving, based on
        innovation in the synthesis and deposition of new gas-sensitive nanomaterials.
        The presentation is focused on advances in metal oxide based gas-sensing devices based on different sensing
        principles and with improved properties. Different technologies for reduction in power consumption will be
        addressed, and application fields revised.
