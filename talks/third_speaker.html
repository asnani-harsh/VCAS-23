        <h4><a href="https://www.ece.seas.gwu.edu/hamed-dalir">https://www.ece.seas.gwu.edu/hamed-dalir</a></h4>
<p>Dr. Dalir has succeeded in securing funding of more than $10 million series from private investors,
    as well as multiple grants from government agencies such as AFWERX, ARO, NSA, ONR and NASA via
    the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)
    programs. Dr. Dalir was a research associate at the University of California - Berkeley in 2016. Since
    then, he has been a senior research scientist with a tech start-up company located in Texas and secured
    more than $4 million as the Principal Investigator (PI) in funding from several SBIR/STTR projects
    supported by NASA, AFOSR, AFWERX, ARMY, NIST, and Broadcom Inc. He has received multiple
    awards, including the Yoshida Foundation Award for Development of Future Leaders for Changing Times
    and Young Scientist Award from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in 2009 and
    2014, respectively. He is a senior member of the OSA, IEEE, and a committee/session chair of the SPIE.
    Dr. Dalir is the Associate Editor of Printed Electronics (Frontiers).</p>

 <h3>Title of the Talk: Modern ASICs and Optoelectronics </h3>
     <p><b>Abtract of the Talk:</b> Technology advancements like 5G and 6G networks, cybersecurity risks, and a renewed interest in space
        travel have all contributed to a renewed emphasis on research and development for cutting-edge
        information processing hardware and computing power. During this session, I will discuss two photonic
        ASICs for machine learning, including experimental validations and scaling rules. Also, I will discuss the
        most up-to-date developments in high-performance optoelectronic devices, such as ITO-based electro-
        optic modulators as next-generation PDK components for photonic integrated circuits. These modulators
        are perfect for high-speed optical interconnect transceivers, dense chip networks used in artificial
        intelligence circuits, and coherent Ising machine annealers due to their tiny size (they are 10,000 times
        smaller than Lithium Niobate modulators). Finally, I&#39;ll talk about our most recent work on electrical ASICs
        at the 10nm node for use in cyber security. In conclusion, I will contextualize these breakthroughs within
        broader macro trends and national agendas, such as Industry 4.0 and the recently enacted $50B CHIPs
        law. </p>
