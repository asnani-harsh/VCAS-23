<h3>Title of the Talk: Smart Mobility: Trends, challenges and future directions.</h3>
<p><b>Abstract of the Talk: </b>In the last decades, we have witnessed an exponential demographic growth of cities, 
    which substantially increases the difficulties of urban planning in terms of mobility, which presents 
    itself as an emerging challenge in all countries. Whether in terms of transport or pedestrian navigation, 
    mobility has taken on a new dimension and represents a problem to which many researchers respond, 
    focusing on the sustainable development of cities. Infrastructures and city design are constantly 
    changing to respond to the daily displacement needs of millions of people from the outskirts to 
    city centers. Sustainable development will be difficult to achieve with the large number of 
    private vehicles as well as with the current public transport network. This talk will focus 
    the major trends, challenges and future directions of smart mobility.</p>
